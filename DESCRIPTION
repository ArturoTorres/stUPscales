Description: Integrated environmental modelling requires coupling sub-models at 
    different spatial and temporal scales, thus accounting for change of support 
    procedures (aggregation and disaggregation). We contribute to state-of-the-art 
    open source tools that support uncertainty propagation analysis in temporal and
    spatio-temporal domains. We implement the tool for uncertainty propagation in 
    environmental modelling, with examples in the urban water domain. 
    The main functionalities of the class setup and the methods and functions MC.setup, 
    MC.sim, MC.analysis, MC.analysis_generic and Agg.t are contained, which are used 
    for setting up, running and analysing Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation simulations, 
    and for spatio-temporal aggregation. We also implement functionalities to model and 
    predict variables that vary in space and time. stUPscales takes uncertainty 
    characterisation and propagation a step further by including temporal and spatio-
    temporal auto- and cross-correlation, resulting in more realistic (spatio-)temporal 
    series of environmental variables. Due to its modularity, the package allows the 
    implementation of additional methods and functions for spatio-temporal disaggregation 
    of model inputs and outputs, when linking models across multiple space-time scales.
