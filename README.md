This is a collection of R routines for Arturo's thesis. This might be devided/merged into other R packages later.

What is new!

AggProp package:
  - 2016-10-22, version 1.0: 
    - several functions for temporal aggregation and uncertainty propagation via Monte Carlo simulation.
    - version for the QUICS deliverable 2.3 (ESR3).
    
STUnc package:
  - 2017-10-04, version 1.0.2: in agreement with nomenclature after Simon's suggestions e.g. V_Tank by V_Chamber

    - added function for discrete sampling. New case 6 in MC.setup.R.
  - 2016-10-22, version 1.0: 
    - several functions for temporal aggregation and uncertainty propagation via Monte Carlo simulation.

stUPscales package:
  - 2017-10-18, named changed from STUnc to stUPscales
